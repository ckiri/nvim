# Nvim Config

Clone this repo into your `~/.config` directory in order for neovim to see and use this configuration.

Config contains my setup with **Gruvbox** as the colorscheme, **Lightline**, **COC** with *Java*
and *C/C++* as language servers as well as some other useful plugins.

Install neccessary software to make sure the plugins are working right:

* xclip
* Python 3 "neovim module" via pip
```zsh
pip install neovim
```
* Python 2
* Python
* ruby & gem
```zsh
gem install neovim
```
* Node.js: "neovim" npm package
```zsh
sudo npm install -g neovim
```
* Perl cpan module "Neovim::Ext"

in **nvim**:
```zsh
:checkhealth
```

Have fun & enjoy!ðŸš€
